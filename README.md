# Gene_links_organizer
A web page to organise information and links of genes

## Description
This was my final project of the course "Programming Foundations with Python" at Udacity (June 2015). 
It consits on a way to make a web page to organise information and links of genes, specially for small projects.
For this purpose, I made a procedure that automatically creates an index of the genes and a customized page for each gene (3 examples are shown).
##Files
The python files are:
prot_info.py (class)                                     
proteins_interest.py (instances and procedures to create the web page).

Html/css files:
template_prot.html: empty file
prot_links1.css: contains the format of the page.

The execution of **'proteins_interest.py'** will automatically create the index and each gene page, and open the index to navegate to each gene.

As I posted the already run procedure, the created pages are also included: 'index.html', 'brca1.html', 'dpc4.html', 'sod1.html'. But you can delete these pages, they will be automatically created by running 'proteins_interest.py'
